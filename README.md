The main goal of the mirror was to keep it simple and minimalistic, as you can see how too much information on the mirror would make it become hard to use or even hard to read or look at. So without losing too much actual mirror space, the information widgets are on the far sides away from the user. This makes it so that the mirror is still a usable mirror. The clock is at the top in bold font so that it is easy to read, and the schedule of events and wheather widgets are on the far left. Keeping the most important pieces of information together, and that coincide with eactoher, makes it easier for the user in that they do not have to search around for applicable information that pertains to the information that they just read. Notfications and news feed are together since those are similar, and are on the right, away from the schedule to not make the mirror convuluted. Underneath the social media is the health widget which includes total hours slept, including whether it was deep or light sleep. The health widget also has daily weight and calories burned for the day for the user to keep track of. Around the mirror are LED lights that can change color, making the mirror not only a light source for the bathroom, but also making it easier to use.
